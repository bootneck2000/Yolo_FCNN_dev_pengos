# Yolo_FCNN_dev_pengos
Developing Computer Vision for counting penguins in Antarctica

The two Faster RCNN (train and test) are deveoped in Jupyterlab notebooks on a macbook pro 2017 model.  The YOLOv8 script was created in Google Colab on the same laptop. 

Both rely on annotated , versioned data (test and train) from Roboflow and utilise the roboflow-provided download scripts (choose Yolo8 formats for each model).
